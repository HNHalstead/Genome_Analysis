### Genome_Analysis

## Project Plan

# Purpose:


To determine relevant genes found in E. faecium E745 that play a role in the 
vancomycin-resistant strain's growth in human serum by looking at differential expression 
analysis between rich medium and heat-inactivated serum conditions. Upon completetion, 
further investigation can be done to test which of the found genes were significant based on
Tn-Seq data analysis.

 


# Steps for Analysis at Minimum
At minimum:

Genome assembly with PacBio reads.
Assembly evaluation.
Structural and functional annotation.
Synteny comparison with a closely related genome.
Reads preprocessing: trimming + quality check (before and after)
RNA-Seq reads alignment against assembled genome.

Additional Steps to be taken:

Plasmid identification
SNPs calling
Evaluate Antibiotic Resistance Potential

# What data is available?
